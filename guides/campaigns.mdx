## What is a campaign?

A campaign represents a measurement study tied to an advertising effort. It tracks ad exposure, collects survey responses, and produces analysis of the campaign's impact on key brand metrics.

## Campaign lifecycle

<Steps>
<Step title="Creation">
  A campaign starts in the **Campaign Service**. Users define:
  - Target audience and demographics
  - Survey questions (awareness, favorability, intent, etc.)
  - Ad server integration settings
  - Flight dates
</Step>

<Step title="Data collection">
  The **Data Collector** connects to external ad servers to:
  - Import creative assets and placement data
  - Track which users were exposed to ads
  - Sync delivery metrics
</Step>

<Step title="Survey distribution">
  During the campaign flight:
  - Exposed and control group users receive surveys
  - Response data flows into the analysis engine
  - The dashboard shows preliminary results
</Step>

<Step title="Analysis">
  The **Analysis Engine** runs statistical tests to determine:
  - Lift (difference between exposed and control groups)
  - Statistical significance of results
  - Demographic breakdowns

  <Tip>
    Results update automatically as new survey responses arrive. Final results are available after the campaign flight ends.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Reporting">
  Final deliverables include:
  - Interactive dashboard with drill-down capabilities
  - Auto-generated summary slide decks
  - Exportable data tables (CSV, Excel)
</Step>
</Steps>
