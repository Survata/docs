## Prerequisites

<Info>
  You need an Acme Analytics account and API key to follow this guide. Contact your account manager if you don't have credentials yet.
</Info>

## Set up your environment

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the repository">
  Clone the repo and navigate to the project root.

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git
  cd your-repo
  ```

  Each service has its own setup. See the [platform overview](/guides/platform-overview) for a map of all services.
</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">
  Install the language toolchain for the service you're working on. Different services may require different runtimes.

  ```bash
  # Example: install Python dependencies
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Start the backing services">
  Most services need a local database. Use Docker Compose to start dependencies.

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Run the service">
  Each service has a standard entrypoint.

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Python service
    python -m acme.main
    ```

    ```bash Java service
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verify it works

Once the service is running, hit the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "status": "UP"
}
```
